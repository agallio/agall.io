Hi everyone! I would like to share my experience being a frontend engineering lead for the largest digital signature company in Indonesia, [PrivyID](https://privy.id). I was 20 years old at that time, and I worked as a frontend engineering lead for about 1 and a half years.

## My Background

I am a vocational high school graduate (in üáÆüá©, we call it SMK). And my school was a vocational high school with a special curriculum. The curriculum is special because in Indonesia, vocational high schools usually only spend 3 years. Meanwhile, I was in school for 4 years.

The 4 years were divided into two phases. The first one is 3 years of learning, and the second one is 1 year of internship.

When I got to the fourth year, I decided to look for an internship. At that time, I only had basic HTML & CSS skills, and my JavaScript skills were far from good. I don't know any modern JavaScript frameworks or libraries. The one and only JavaScript library that I know back then was, jQuery.

However, the company that accepted me as an intern requires me to use a modern JavaScript framework, namely React. So, I was required to be able to learn and adapt quickly. And I, who was just a young child, ended up feeling very difficult and confused because I didn't know how to learn and adapt quickly.

At that time, I hadn't found the right learning method for me. I tried all the learning methods that I knew at the time. And the most effective way that I found is by following online courses on YouTube and Udemy.

But, these online courses only teach the basics. When I encountered a more complex task, I got confused. I am grateful that in my internship period, I had many senior mentors in this field. They were happy to help me to solve many complex problems I was facing at that time. I also learned from them, how to read and learn from the documentation.

From this experience, I finally have a strong foundation to go deeper into the world of frontend engineering. Over time I was trusted to be a mentor for my colleagues. Also, I was entrusted by my vocational high school to be a mentor for my juniors who will take part in the web engineering competitions.

## My Journey

My journey to becoming a leader started at the start of 2020 when I was promoted to be the frontend engineering lead. Everybody knows that being a leader is hard.

There would be more and more people are looking for me, and also many important decisions are up to me. Because of that, it is clear that being good at coding isn't enough. There are many other non-coding skills that I should learn.

Before I go through it one by one, I would like to share the important attitudes that I've learned, first.

### Attitude Skills (Soft-skills)

1. **Honesty**<br/>
   This first point is might be a little bit cliche. But in my opinion, this is precisely the most important point.

   > "Lack of intelligence can be corrected by learning. Lack of competence can be eliminated by experience. However, dishonesty is difficult to fix." <br/> - **Muhammad Hatta**

   From the quote above, I firmly believe that honesty is above all else. In my opinion, honesty is the main foundation. Since many people are believing in me, I must be accountable to them by being honest.

   So I learned to be honest and open to my real situation and knowledge. If I didn't know something, I said, "I don't know". If I know, I said, "I know". Because lying will only cause new conflicts and problems.

   When I am being honest with myself, I can understand my weaknesses and strengths. So I know, what should I improve and learn more deeply. Honesty, also makes me understand **what I really want**.

2. **Goals**<br/>
   Because I understand **what I really want**, I can set goals. So I understand, what I should improve and learn. For example, I was a person who is very bad at public speaking. With the honesty and self-awareness that I had, I finally had a goal, which is to be able to be great at public speaking. So, I started to improve my public speaking, by speaking and communicating my ideas to more and more people.

   The day-to-day result isn't great. There must be failures in every new thing I learned. However, because I had that goal, I became persistent and never gave up. I keep learning and trying. Failures and mistakes also made me learn more and became my provision so as not to fall into the same hole.

3. **Care & Awareness**<br/>
   When I can be honest with myself and have goals and purposes, I can care for and become aware of those around me. When I started to care and be aware, I realized that I was not alone. Many people also have difficulty in achieving their goals. I also learned a lot when someone shared his failure story, and how he continued to persevere to achieve his goals.

   Caring also makes me happy to share. Because I feel I have learned a lot from those who are willing to share stories of their failures and successes. Caring also humbles me. When some friends or colleagues need my help in coding or non-coding tasks, I am happy to help and willing to share knowledge.

### Technical Skills (Hard-skills)

And now I'll go through it one by one. Back then, I was too focused on developing only my coding skills. But, these non-coding skills below are what made me trusted to be a leader.

- **Exploration** - The software engineering industry is growing rapidly, so I should be able to explore and learn new things fast. Especially if, the upcoming tasks are something that unknown to me. Also with exploration, I could find new things that can make my work faster and more efficient.

- **Planning** - I learned that skill to prepare things that must be done to achieve a certain goal is important. The process of achieving a goal also becomes more meaningful, because there are small steps that make me understand where I've reached.

- **Communication & Collaboration** - Being able to communicate and collaborate with the team is very crucial. In my day-to-day work, I will always work with a team. The ability to communicate ideas, as well as suggestions and criticisms to the team is something that can improve collaboration, and eventually, it will improve the team performance.

- **Code Review** - Being able to review my code is important. So I understand which ones can be made simpler, which ones I can improve on, and which ones are not in best practices. After being able to review my code, I can review code written by other people. This ability allows me to frequently discuss with colleagues the effectiveness, the readability, and the best practices of the code.

- **Security, Performance, Accessibility & Usability Testing** - In my opinion, these skillsets are categorized as advanced skillsets in software engineering. Because many engineers stop after writing solid code and make them run properly. But these skillsets are often forgotten. I realized that these things are no less important than writing great code. My code might be solid, but it is very prone to issues and loopholes if I neglect and forget these things.

- **Writing Documentation** - This has always been a scourge for me. I initially didn't like to write documentation, because I prefer to teach someone directly for a project or library that I worked on. However, I can't always teach each person one by one. That's why I need to write documentation, so people can learn from it.

- **Mentoring** - Mentoring is an accompaniment in a learning process that makes me and my colleagues more aware of each other knowledge. It also a chance to recognize each other views on how to solve problems. It helps myself and my colleagues to grow together and making the collaborations even better.

Writing solid code is great. But from what I learned, with those soft-skill and hard-skills above combined, is what made me entrusted to lead a team. I am far from perfect. I just try to learn it day-by-day. And the most important thing is, I don't need permissions to do those things.

> "If you act like a leader, people will see you as a leader"

That's what my engineering manager says when he promoted me. In the future, I will also promote people who not only excel in coding skills but also exceptional at those non-coding skills too.

In final words, I am grateful to have been trusted as a front-end engineering lead. I learned a lot and will continue to learn to be a better leader. Thanks for reading, stay safe, and have a nice day. üòÅ
